###  The graph for the Loss and Accuracy for VGG1 with and without Augmentation and Transfer Learning are: 

1. **VGG1 graph:**

    >!['VGG1'](VGG1_plot.png)

    > Accuracy: 95 % (epochs=20)

2. **VGG1 graph with Data Augmentation:**

    >!['VGG2'](VGG_with_Aug_plot.png)

    > Accuracy: 90%  (epochs=20)

3. **Transfer Learning:**

    >!['Transfer'](Transfer_plot.png)

    > Accuracy: 100%  (epoch=5)
