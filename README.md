# LogisticRegression_NeuralNetwork

1. **Logistic Regression** 
    
    > There are two python files under LogisticRegression, they are LogisticRegression.py and Softmax.py

    > Logistic is for two class classification and softmax is for multi class classification.

2. **Neural Network**

    > NN.py contains code for Neural network from scratch, but with the help of autograd for backpropegation. 

    > It has three different activation functions: {relu , sigmoid , Identity}

3. **CNN**

    > CNN_Classification.py contains the code to classify images using CNN.
    
    > The code was copied from [Here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-convolutional-neural-network-to-classify-photos-of-dogs-and-cats/)
